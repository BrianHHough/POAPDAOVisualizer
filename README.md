# Description:

Being in and contributing to several DAOs over the past year, one of the coolest applications I have seen of decentralized governance is with Snapshot voting where as soon as you vote, you can mint a POAP NFT of your participation in the web3 voting experience. You can also receive POAPs and NFTs for attending events, meetups, Twitter Spaces, Clubhouse rooms, online conferences, community calls, and the list just goes on and on.

The amount of NFTs one could theoretically get via a DAO can be immense, so wouldn't it be optimal to have an NFT visualizer of these POAP collections, all in one place, simply by logging in via your web3 wallet.

POAP DAO Visualizer is a weekend hack designed to explore new tools in web3 and ultimately show DAO members how much they have contributed to their organization, membership, and in furthering the web3 community overall.

# Tech Stack:

- Front-End: NEXTjs with TypeScript
- Data Layer / API: The Graph Protocol + GraphQL
- Back-End: Ethers.js (Web3 API) + Solidity (Smart Contracts) + Moralis (Web3 Database + Hooks)
- Blockchain: xDai (Gnosis) Chain + POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol)

The app leverages NEXTjs with TypeScript hard-typing for the front-end framework, a Data Layer / API using the Graph Protocol + GraphQL and Covalent, the back-end leverages the Ethers.js (Web3 API), and Moralis (Web3 Database + Hooks), and reads data from the xDai (Gnosis) Chain, Ethereum mainnet, and the POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) chain.
